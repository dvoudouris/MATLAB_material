%% Exercise 1
% a. Multiply 3 by 8 and divide this product by the difference between 13 and 7

% b. If you sleep on average 6h per night, how many seconds did you spend sleeping the last two nights?


%% Exercise 2
% a. Calculate the number of seconds in a non-leap year (365 days)
% Assign the answer to a variable with a meaningful name.

% b. Create a column vector named "threes" that contains 795 times the value 3

% c. Create a vector named "desc" with values starting from 100 and ending at 0 in steps of 2 (100, 98, 96, ..., 0)


%% Exercise 3
% a. There is a right triangle with sides a = 15, b = 20, c = ?
% Find the length of side c using the Pythagorean theorem (look it up if you do not remember it)
% The value of c is equal to the square root of c to the power of 2. 

% b. How would you calculate c, if a = 19 and b = 23?


%% Exercise 4
% There is a person who likes brewing beer. They store the beer in a
% cylindrical barrel that has a length of 2 m and a radius of 2 m. Now
% they want to construct another barrel with the same length (2 m) but with volume that is 20% more
% than that of the current barrel. How large should the radius of the new barrel be?
% Note: The volume of the barrel is equal to V = ? * r^2 * h, and that pi = 3.14
% (r is the radius, h is the height)


%% Exercise 5
% Create an m-file with a script that converts a Fahrenheit temperature (say, 95 deg) to Celsius. 
% Think of a reasonable name when saving this m-file. 
% In how many ways can you execute this file? Try them out.
% To do the conversion from F to C, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit value and multiply the difference by 5/9.


%% Exercise 6
% Create a vector "age_t1" with the ages of a football team's players:                  [22, 21, 25, 19, 30, 28, 31, 36, 20, 23, 22]
% Create a new vector "age_t1_future" that contains the ages of these people in 3 years
% Create another vector "age_t2" with the ages of another team's players:               [25, 23, 25, 26, 29, 33, 32, 21, 27, 30, 30]
% Calculate variable "age_diff" as the difference in age between "age_t2" and "age_t1"
% What is the average value of the new vector "age_diff"?


%% Exercise 7
% a. Create the following vectors:
% Vector x contains numbers from 1 to 100 in steps of 1
% Vector y contains numbers from 10 to 0 in steps of 0.1
% Vector z contains the first 50 elements of x, and the last 50 elements of y

% b. Create vector v1 that contains 78 sevens: (7 7 7...7)
% Set the value of the 2nd and every other element after that to 99:
% so vector v1 should be: 7 99 7 99 ... 99

% c. Create new vector v2 with values between 10 and 199 in steps of 3
% Create vector v3 that contains the last 39 elements of v2

% d. Assign the 39 values of v3 to the 39 indices of v1 that have values equal to 99


%% Exercise 8
% a. Create a set of column vectors related to a dummy experiment:
% The first vector is named 'subject' and contains the subject ID (1 to 15).
% The next is named 'age' and has the age of each subject. 
%   Create the age vector by using random integers between 18 and 35 (you need to look up how to do so).
% The third vector is named 'height' and has the height (in cm) of each subject. 
%   Create such a vector with random integers between 155 and 190.

% b. Calculate the median age and the median height across your subjects
% Can you find two different ways to calculate the medians?
