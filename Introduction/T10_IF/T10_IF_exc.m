%% Exercise 1

% Write some code that asks for input about an integer m and then assigns to the variable x:
%   the value of 1 when m is larger than 0, 
%   the value of 0 when m is 0, and 
%   the value of -1 when m is less than 0.


%% Exercise 2

% Write some code that asks for a coordinate point in a XY Cartesian coordinate system
% and then determines in which quadrant the coordinate point lies.
% If you are unsure about what an XY Cartesian system is, then remin yourself with the following link:

%% Exercise 3

% Write some code that asks for a three different integers, separated with space, in a single field of an input window. 
% The code should then determine which of the three is the largest.
% The answer should be: The first, the second or the third number


%% Exercise 4

% Write some code that loads the file 'demo' and plots the data of column 15.
% In the same figure, add a square around the maximal value of the plotted curve. The color of this square should be:
%      red, if the maximal value is equal or higher 5 units
%      green if the maximal value is between 2 and 5
%      blue, if the maximal value is less then 2
