%% Exercise 1

% a. Set random number generator to 1
% Create array x with 20 random integers between -5 and 16

% b. Create array y with 20 random integers between 15 and 50

% c. Find elements of x that are greater than 0

% d. Find elements of x that are smaller or equal to -1

% e. Find elements of y that are greater than 20 and smaller than 30

% f. Find elements that have x greater than zero AND y smaller than 50


%% Exercise 2

% a. Set random number generator to 1
% Create a 200 x 2 matrix m
% Column 1 has values from 1 to 200 in steps of 1
% Column 2 has random integers between 50 and 80

% b. Find those elements of column 1 that have a value greater than 20 and smaller than 50

% c. Find those elements of column 2 that have a value greater than 75

% d. Find the first element of column 2 that has a value greater than 55

% e.  Find the first five elements of column 2 that have a value smaller than 55


%% Exercise 3

% a. Load the file trial_1 under variable name 'data'

% b. Plot the data of the 1st column against the data of the 2nd column

% c. Find the first index of the first column that has a value smaller than 700.
% Put this index in a variable named 's'

% d. Find the index of the third column that has the maximal value of that
% Put this index in a variable named 'f'

% e. Plot in another figure the data of the 1st column against the data of
% the second column BUT only between indices 's' and 'f'


%% Exercise 4

% The previous file contains positional data (x, y, z) of an object moving in space. The data are in mm. 
% Find a way to plot the data x (col 1) against data y (col 2) between the moment when 
%   a) the moment when the speed of this object exceeds 0.3 mm/sample (first plotted point), and 
%   b) the moment when the speed drops back below 0.3 mm/sample (final plotted point)
